This digital clock has FB messenger included and the color you see is based on the current time. The numbers are converted to an HSL color by placing a hash in front of them. For example  8:21 = #821000. For messenger wait 30 seconds on the page and the bubble should appear in the bottom right.![Screenshot 2023-12-16 at 9.37.10â€¯AM.png](/Screenshot%202023-12-16%20at%209.37.10%E2%80%AFAM.png)
